# HoBooS-Front
A simple front-end implementation for HoBooS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Requirements`

[MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/), [HoBooS](https://github.com/Akash-Kanojia/hoboos)

### `Make Sure before you start`
Also this frontend doesn't cover admin endpoints like create hotels and rooms hence use the
dump given in `HoBooS` repository which will populate few hotels and rooms in database.

HoBoos api server is running at localhost:8090

Thats it you are ready to use front-end.
